# Task List: Creating domainCategories.json

The `domainCategories.json` file was created through an iterative process of discovery, categorization, and refinement. The following steps were taken:

1.  **Initial Domain Definition:** A broad set of initial domains was defined based on common business functions and application types. Examples were added from a UK context.
2.  **Internet Scouring with Perplexity:** The Perplexity tool was used to search for lists of popular applications, data sources, and APIs, focusing on identifying their primary domain of operation. Queries such as "list of business software categories", "list of software categories specific to the construction industry", "list of software categories specific to the hospitality industry", "list of software categories specific to law enforcement", and "list of software categories specific to social services" were used.
3.  **Categorization and JSON Addition:** The identified applications and data sources were categorized under the appropriate domains, adding them to a JSON structure.
4.  **Iteration and Refinement:** Steps 2 and 3 were repeated, refining the domain list and adding new domains as needed.
5.  **Redundancy Check:** The list was reviewed for any categories that were essentially the same, and these were consolidated or aliased.
6.  **Holisticity Check:** The list was reviewed to ensure that it covered all major areas of software and API usage.
7.  **Sense Check:** A random sample of 5 domains was selected, and Perplexity was used to search for related APIs to verify the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the categorization.
8.  **Alphabetization:** The keys in the JSON object were alphabetized.

The goal was to create a comprehensive and well-organized list of software categories, striving for 100% coverage of all software and API use cases.
